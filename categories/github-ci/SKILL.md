# GitHub CI Bundle

Use this when the user asks for GitHub Actions, PR review comments, or repository workflow setup.

Do not treat this folder as one normal skill. This folder is a bundle manifest.

1. Open `paths.txt` in this folder.
2. For each non-empty line, install the skill at `https://github.com/iice257/Skills/tree/main/<path>`.
3. Show the user the skills you installed.
4. If any path fails, report that exact path and continue with the remaining paths.
5. After installing, tell the user: `Restart Codex to pick up the new skills.`
